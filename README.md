Some of these I solved myself, and THEN used ChatGPT to answer it too just to see how it performs these coding problems, as well as getting some prompting training with real problems. The GPT generated solutions should have a comment explaining why I used it, and if a spefic prompting technique worked better.

Some of them JUST have GPT solutions. These are the problems that were the Daily Challenge, and for those I give myself a 1-hour time limit to try and solve on my own. If I don't get it solved in the time limit, I try and use GPT to solve the issue using Chain of Thought techniques and prompt tweaking. This way I get some prompt engineering practice as well so I don't feel like I completely wasted my time. When I get to these problems on my own, I plan on solving them myself normally.
